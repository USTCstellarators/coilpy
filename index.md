# CoilPy: Python package for plotting and data processing

This is the GitHub pages for CoilPy.
CoilPy is my personal python packages.
It contains python functions for 2D & 3D plotting and data processing.
Right now, it has about 100 functions for stellarator optimization codes, like FOCUS, VMEC, REGCOIL, SPEC, FIELDLINES, etc.

The python 2.7 version can be found [here](https://github.com/zhucaoxiang/CoilPy/tree/old), with a simple instruction ([Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/zhucaoxiang/CoilPy/blob/old/coilpy_py2.ipynb), [html](coilpy_py2.html)).

Right now, I am working on moving evreythin to Python 3. A simple tutorial can be found at [CoilPy_tutrorial_FOCUS](CoilPy_tutorial.html).

Any comments and suggestions are welcome. Please contact Dr. Caoxiang Zhu (czhu@pppl.gov).
